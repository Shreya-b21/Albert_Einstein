    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His famous equation E=mcÂ² explains the relationship between energy (E) and mass (m). Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein's contributions revolutionized our understanding of the universe.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
      Einstein showed an early interest in mathematics and physics. He attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900. After graduation, Einstein worked as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office, where he had ample time to pursue his scientific inquiries.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Contributions and Achievements</h2>
    <p>
      Einstein's most famous work is the theory of relativity, published in 1915. His theory challenged the long-held Newtonian mechanics and introduced a new understanding of gravity. He also made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. He continued to work in academia and made important contributions until his death on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey. Einstein's legacy continues to inspire and influence scientists and thinkers to this day.
